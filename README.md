# project-one

An exploration on the changes in electroencepholography (EEG) measurements in students during states of concentration and confusion. 
We are curious about the relationship of confused mental states and its visualization in EEG Data.
Observations related to these patterns suggest a a possible biomarker for cognitive performance, in addition to a greater understastanding
on the mechanisms of cognitive work in the human brain.

## Project One Proposal

## Project Title: 
The Brains of Confused Students

## Team Members:

## Project Description:
An exploration on the changes in electroencephalography (EEG)
measurements in students during states of concentration and confusion. We are curious about
the relationship of confused mental states and its visualization in EEG Data. Observations
related to these patterns suggest a possible biomarker for cognitive performance, in addition to
a greater understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive work in the human brain.

## Research Questions to Answer (preliminary):
1. What frequency Band is pronounced in relation to attention?(attention vs freq color
coded to alpha,beta,theta,delta)
2. What Frequency Band is most pronounced in confused Students vs non confused
students?
3. Are ‘calm students' more likely to be confused? (confusion user defined vs calm) and
(non confusion user defined vs calm)

## Breakdown:
1. Merge Demographics and EEG Data dataframes
2. Utilize “.groupby()” and “.loc[]” functions to segment dataframe to relevant groups
3. Utilize MatPlotLib to visualize EEG Data
4. Summarize Findings to answer our research questions.
